# Document-Classification-for-COVID-19-Literature

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a deluge of research publications related tovarious aspects of the virus.  From research into COVID-19 transmission mechanisms to the public health response of various countries, there is a lot of information that needs to be categorized for easier and more efficient access to resources.  This project explores various machine learning based document classification techniques to categorize COVID-19 related literature.  We integrate a novel terminology dictionary with themachine learning models to study the impact on the effectiveness of various classificationtechniques.  We report a slight boost to F1 scores as a result of our modifications. The termolator techniques used in this project can be found and downloaded here: https://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/termolator/
